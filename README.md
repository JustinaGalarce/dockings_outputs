# Outputs dockings from "Enhancing the Reliability of Integrated Consensus Strategies to Boost Docking-Based Screening Campaigns using Publicly Available Docking Programs"

Inside the .zip there can be found all of the docking results divided in folders. Each folder is named after the target used. Inside each target folder, you will find the docking outputs in .sdf format from all the docking programs used: AutoDock4, DOCK6, AutoDock Vina, PLANTS, rDock, and ICM. 
The file names are formatted as "out_target_program.sdf," where "program" corresponds to the program used (i.e., ad, dock, vina, pl, rd, and icm, respectively). 
Each .sdf file contains the poses of all the database entries for that specific target and program, along with the corresponding score for each pose.
